# Summary
- Using the Leaflet Javascript Library (https://leafletjs.com/), this takes Earthquake data from the last 7 days and plots it onto a map.
- The data used is from https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes and https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates
- Data points scale with magnitude level
- Data points colors change with depth level
- Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth, as well as a link to more information on the earthquake
- In Leflet-Part-2, tectonic plate data is also included in the map, outlining the tectonic plates.
